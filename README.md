# Baghdad-AI
Code repository for the project Baghdad AI.

This repository contains the code described in the paper "Bridging the past: integrating old satellite imagery for lost site identification in Abu Ghraib through CNN models" by A.Pistola, V.Orr√π, N.Marchetti and M.Roccetti.

The Python script stampa_imm_qgis is a script to be used inside QGIS. It contains functions to save the input images and target masks for the segmentation models starting from the shapefiles included in the zip folder and using a Bing basemaps and Corona basemaps (https://corona.cast.uark.edu/atlas). Notice that when saving the input images all layers other than the basemap should be set to invisible. On the other hand when saving masks site shapes should be the only visible layer and should be styled as all black filled polygons (a QGIS style is included)

The iPython notebook contains all the code needed to train and evaluate models.

The remaining contents are support .csv and .json files that made deveopment easier.
